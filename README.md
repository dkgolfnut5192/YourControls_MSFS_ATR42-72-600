Profile to work with YourControls application and MSFS2020. If you find any bugs, please contact me on YourControls Discord: Dkgolfnut_Dennis

*** I have created 2 files for this due to issues with synchronization isssues with Knobs for Speed TGT, Decision Height, (FCGP) ALT, Pitch Wheel, and Course. ***

*** On the File Named ATR 42-72-600_DKGOLFNUT_V1_3_Without KNOBS.yml the synchorination ont the knobs mentioned above is commented out. WHat this means is you will have to manually synch by verbally discussing any movement to those knobs and Manually adjusting them in both Planes (Pilot and First Officer) ***


Known Issues:
For Profile with KNOBS, dials mentioned above must be turned very slowly for them to synch

For Profile WITHOUT KNOBS the buttons mentioned above will have to be manually sichroinized with pilot and First Officer so the planes will be coordinated in configuration changes

PROP GURAD may not be Synched

FIXED:
First release so none noted


I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
